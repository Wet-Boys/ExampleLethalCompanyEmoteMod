Some things will have changed slightly since the tutorial video was created. 

The main aspect is the folder "Custom Animation Folder" exists now. 

In order to make animations you create with the ChadRig more accurate, there is a slightly different process after you animate your emote. 

If you are using animations from elsewhere do not worry about it

Also, feel free to clear "junk" out if you don't need it, notably all the jotaro stuff which is just leftover as an example. 

And please please please, create a base folder for your mod with your mod name, this is the easiest way to avoid conflicts with other mods having the same file paths
